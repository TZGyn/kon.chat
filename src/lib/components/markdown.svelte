It executes a block of code repeatedly, once for each item in the sequence.\n\n**Basic Syntax**\n\n```python\nfor item in sequence:\n # Code to be executed for each item\n # You can use the 'item' variable within this block\n```\n\n* **`for` keyword:** This signals the start of the loop.\n* **`item`:** â€¦: 0, j: 1\ni: 1, j: 0\ni: 1, j: 1\ni: 2, j: 0\ni: 2, j: 1\n```\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* `for` loops are used for iterating over sequences or iterables.\n* Indentation is crucial in Python to define the loop's body.\n* `range()` is commonly used to generate a sequence of numbers for looping.\n* `break` and `continue` provide control over the loop's execution.\n* The `else` clause executes if the loop completes without a `break`.\n* Nested loops allow you to iterate over multiple levels of data.\n"

Here's a simple example of a Python \`for\` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:\n\`\`\`python\n# Loop through the range of numbers from 1 to 10\nfor number in range(1, 11):\nprint(number)\n\`\`\`\n\n### Explanation:\n- \`range(1, 11)\` generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) 11.\n- The \`for\` loop iterates through each number in that range, and the \`print\` function outputs each number.\n\nIf you have a specific task in mind that you would like to perform using a \`for\` loop, let me know, and I can provide a more tailored example!\n"
